# Description
I often keep forgetting small tasks or deadlines when Iâ€™m busy on my computer. To solve this, I built Get-It-Done â€” a Chrome Extension that lets you quickly add tasks, save them locally, and get timely notifications when a task is due.

This project was created to improve personal productivity, act as a lightweight to-do manager, and demonstrate how Chrome Extensions can be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This extension can help you:

âœ” Stay organized

âœ” Remember important deadlines

âœ” Get reminders without needing a heavy app
#  Key Features

- Add and manage tasks directly from the popup

- Automatic saving with Chrome Storage API (tasks persist even if you close the browser)

- Custom notifications for upcoming tasks (using Alarms + Notifications API)

- Minimal UI so you can focus on what needs to be done
